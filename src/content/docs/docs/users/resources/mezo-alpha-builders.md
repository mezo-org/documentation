title: Mezo Alpha Builder Program
---

## Overview

Bitcoin is missing a native ecosystem with financial tools that let users borrow, spend, and earn without selling their coins. Mezo solves this by building a Bitcoin native capital infrastructure: no middlemen, no variable rates, and no selling your BTC. Mezo empowers builders to build, grow, and redefine what’s possible with Bitcoin

Join the Alpha Builder Program to co-create Mezo’s infrastructure and experience while integrating MUSD into products to enrich user bases, generate new daily financial use cases, and access comprehensive support provided by Mezo

Apply by [completing the questionnaire](https://2d0lnha7ee6.typeform.com/to/B9jzgjb6). 

## Focus Area

We are seeking innovative BitcoinFi dApps—whether DeFi, SocialFi, or something else entirely—that enhance the usability of MUSD and enable everyday financial transactions on Bitcoin. Mainnet brings Mezo’s architectural philosophy to life through two complementary environments: the [Cathedral and Bazaar](https://blog.mezo.org/the-cathedral-and-the-bazaar/), creating a unified onchain experience that serves both experienced users and newcomers:

- **The Cathedral:** A secure, reliable DeFi ecosystem offering recognizable and easy-to-use financial tools. The Cathedral houses Mezo’s core infrastructure—seamlessly integrated swap, lend, borrow, bridge, and stake functionalities designed specifically for Bitcoin. This eliminates the friction of scattered or duplicated DeFi apps by consolidating essential functions under one Bitcoin-centric architecture.
- **The Bazaar:** Beyond core lending and borrowing, the Mezo community can develop SocialFi, GameFi, and experimental dApps. All hosted on Mezo and backed by Bitcoin. This permissionless playground empowers builders to innovate freely while leveraging Mezo’s native infrastructure, fostering a diverse ecosystem that encourages new use cases for Bitcoin.
