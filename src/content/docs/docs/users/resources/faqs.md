## What is Mezo?

Mezo is a Bitcoin finance app that empowers people to live off their Bitcoin without spending it. Flagship features include Mezo Borrow and MUSD.

## What can I do with Mezo? 

Mezo builds products to help bring utility to BTC without the need to spend it. You can set up a loan with Mezo Borrow to mint MUSD which can be spent for a variety of use cases. The vision is to ultimately create and lead the Bitcoin circular economy, where MUSD can be used for larger purchases such as a home, as well as day-to-day purchases, such as groceries or your daily coffee. 

## Why should I use Mezo?

If you want to finally be able to live off your Bitcoin without spending it, Mezo is the place for you. By using your Bitcoin as collateral, you can set up a credit line with Mezo Borrow benefiting from the lowest interest rates in the industry (1-5%) at a fixed rate. This allows you to access BitcoinFi, as well as everyday items that you can find in the Mezo Market. 

## What are Mezo’s flagship features?

Mezo’s products are aligned with the mission to build a Bitcoin-backed financial paradigm for the many, not the few. Mezo builds products to build this future together with the community. With that in mind, the following products support this approach: 

* Mezo Borrow
* MUSD 
* Tigris (coming soon)

## How do I borrow against my Bitcoin?

MUSD is Mezo’s Bitcoin-backed stablecoin, 1 MUSD can be redeemed for $1 of BTC. To borrow MUSD, you lock up BTC as collateral.

* If the protocol’s total collateral ratio remains strong (over 150% backing):
  * New loans need a minimum 110% collateral (e.g. $110 of BTC per 100 MUSD of debt).
  * If your collateral drops below 110%, your position can be liquidated.
* If total backing falls below 150%:
  * New loans must be secured at 150% collateral.

## How can I use Mezo for my dapp/project?

Passport makes it easy for developers to integrate Bitcoin wallet support into dApps building on Mezo. Built on top of RainbowKit, it supports popular Bitcoin wallets like Unisat, Xverse, and OKX, alongside EVM-compatible wallets like Taho and MetaMask. The package includes helper hooks for reading balances, managing wallet connections, and sending both Bitcoin and Mezo transactions.
