title: Connect your wallet to Mezo
---

To connect your browser wallet, use the network details for either Mainnet or the Testnet.

You can add Mezo to your wallet using the **Connect Wallet** button at Chainlist:

- Mainnet: [https://chainlist.org/chain/31612](https://chainlist.org/chain/31612)
- Testnet: [https://chainlist.org/chain/31611](https://chainlist.org/chain/31611)

If Chainlist does not work, add the network manually using the network details below.

## BTC Wallets

BTC wallets are supported in the Mezo App and can receive a Mezo network address associated with your BTC wallet. BTC wallets can currently complete the following tasks on Mezo:

- Bridge BTC Assets
- Bridge EVM Assets
- Borrow, repay, or manage collateral for a loan
- Purchase items on the MUSD Market
- Receive Assets on the Mezo Network

BTC wallets cannot currently send assets on the Mezo Network.

As the network evolves, more features and capabilities will be made available to BTC wallets.
