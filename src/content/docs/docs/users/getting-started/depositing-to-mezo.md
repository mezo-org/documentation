You can deposit native Bitcoin or supported ERC-20 tokens to Mezo Mainnet. 

Note that depositing funds is currently a one-way operation. Check official Discord or Twitter channels for updates on two-way bridging.

## Before you begin

- Check which assets are supported. You can confirm the token addresses for these addresses on the [Contracts Referecne](/docs/users/resources/contracts-reference#mainnet-asset-token-contracts) page.

## Deposit your assets

1. Go to the [Mezo App](https://mezo.org/overview) and sign in with a supported wallet.
1. After you sign in and sign the transaction, click **Deposit**.
1. Select the asset you want to deposit and specify the amount.
