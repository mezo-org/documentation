title: Supported Wallets
---

Current wallets supported are Metamask, Taho, WalletConnect, Unisat, and OKX.

We support **all Bitcoin address types**, except for Taproot, from UniSat, OKX, and Xverse wallets. Users with BTC on a Ledger device can use Xverse to access Mezo. We will soon add support for MagicEden and expand Ledger support.
