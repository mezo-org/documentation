After entering the deposit portal, you'll want to claim the invitation code you used by logging in with a wallet. This can be done with either a Bitcoin wallet or an Ethereum wallet.

### Log In With Bitcoin

Click "Connect Bitcoin Wallet" or "Log in" in the top right to see our "[Log in with Bitcoin](https://blog.mezo.org/log-in-with-bitcoin-on-mezo/)" page.&#x20;

**IMPORTANT:** Once you proceed with the login and sign the transaction, your wallet will be connected to the invite code. You may deposit BTC from alternative addresses, but your connected wallet will accumulate mats.

The following UniSat connect and sign transactions are prompted after you click "Log in with Bitcoin."

You will have similar transactions to sign if you use an OKX wallet.

Congrats! You've now claimed your code and can proceed with depositing.

### Log in with Ethereum

Alternatively, you can log in with Ethereum-based browser wallets. Click the "Log in with Ethereum instead" link at the bottom.&#x20;

We support Taho, MetaMask, and WalletConnect at the moment.

**IMPORTANT:** Once you proceed with the login and sign the transaction, your wallet will be connected to the invite code and will accumulate mats.
