You can deposit native Bitcoin or supported ERC-20 tokens (Bitcoin wrappers) to Mezo Mainnet. 

Note that bridging funds is currently a one-way operation.

## Before you begin

- Check which assets are supported. You can confirm the token addresses for these addresses on the [Contracts Reference](/docs/users/resources/contracts-reference#mainnet-asset-token-contracts) page.

## Deposit your assets

1. Go to the [Mezo App](https://mezo.org/overview) and sign in with a supported wallet.
1. After you sign in and sign the transaction, click **Deposit Bitcoin**.
1. Select the asset you want to bridge and specify the amount.

1. If the transaction is acceptable, confirm the transaction.

After the transaction is complete, the bridging process begins. The process can take several minutes to complete before you receive your assets on Mainnet.
