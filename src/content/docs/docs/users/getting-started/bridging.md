You can bridge native Bitcoin or supported ERC-20 tokens to Mezo Mainnet. 

Note that bridging funds is currently a one-way operation.

## Before you begin

- Check which assets are supported. You can confirm the token addresses for these addresses on the [Contracts Referecne](/docs/users/resources/contracts-reference#mainnet-asset-token-contracts) page.

## Bridge your assets

1. After you sign in and sign the transaction, click **Add funds**.
1. Select the asset you want to bridge and specify the amount.
