You can create an account in the Mezo Portal to manage rewards, create and manage deposits, borrow and mint MUSD, and access Mezo Market.

1. Go to the [Mezo Portal](https://mezo.org/home).

1. Click the **Sign in** button.

1. Click **Sign up** and log in with your browser wallet. If you want to use an Ethereum wallet, click **Sign in with Ethereum instead** at the bottom of the sign in window.

1. Connect your wallet and confirm the transaction to complete the sign up process.

After you complete login and sign the transaction, your wallet will be connected to the account. You may deposit BTC from alternative addresses, but your connected wallet manages the account.
