You can deposit native Bitcoin or supported ERC-20 tokens to the Mezo App to earn mats. Note that this is separate from collateral that you deposit to borrow MUSD. If you want to borrow MUSD, see the [Borrow and Mint MUSD]() guide.

## Before you begin

1. Go to the [Mezo App](https://mezo.org/overview) and connect with a supported wallet.
1. After you sign in and sign the transaction, go to [mezo.org/deposit?tab=new-deposit](https://mezo.org/deposit?tab=new-deposit) to access the deposit page.
1. Verify which assets are supported for deposits. In the **New Deposit** screen, check the asset dropdown menu to find the complete list.

## Making a deposit

1. Open [mezo.org/deposit](https://mezo.org/deposit) to see the Deposit page in the Mezo App.

1. Click the **New Deposit** tab to begin a new deposit.

1. Select the asset you want to deposit, and specify the amount.

1. Click the **Deposit** button and approve the transaction in your browser wallet.

If the transaction is successful, you will be able to see and manage the deposit on the [mezo.org/deposit](https://mezo.org/deposit) page.
