Mezo matsnet is the testnet you can use for testing features and dApps before moving to [Mezo Mainnet](../mainnet/).

To get started, use the Mezo Portal to convert mats to matsnet BTC that you can use to pay gas fees on Mezo matsnet. Then, connect a browser wallet or use Hardhat, Foundry, and Remix to deploy contracts.

* [Stack matsnet BTC](./mezo-matsnet-alpha-testnet/stack-matsnet-btc)
* [Connect to Mezo matsnet](./mezo-matsnet-alpha-testnet/connect-to-mezo-matsnet)

To learn how to build and deploy applications on Mezo, see the [Developer Getting Started](/docs/developers/getting-started) guide.
