mUSD is Mezo's native stablecoin, which is 100% backed by Bitcoin reserves to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. By depositing your Bitcoin as collateral at a minimum ratio of 110%, you can mint mUSD and access liquidity while keeping your Bitcoin position intact.

mUSD is based on [Threshold USD](https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev) which is a fork of [Liquity](https://github.com/liquity/dev) for the [Mezo Network](https://mezo.org).
