mUSD is an over-collateralized stable coin backed by bitcoin, this type of stable coin is known as a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP). This is similar to currencies backed by gold where you can can deposit gold with the bank to get paper money or redeem that paper money with the bank to get gold back. In typical market conditions, mUSD holders can redeem 1 mUSD for $1 USD worth of bitcoin.

Users who deposit BTC and borrow mUSD receive a line of credit with a fixed interest rate based on the amount of BTC deposited. The interest rate floats but gets fixed for the life of the line of credit when it is opened. For a small fee, borrowers can refinance the interest rate on their deposited BTC loan or change the size of the loan.

mUSD is based on [Threshold USD](https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev) which is a fork of [Liquity](https://github.com/liquity/dev) for the [Mezo Network](https://mezo.org).
