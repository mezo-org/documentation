## Before you begin

Before you can get testnet MUSD, you must complete the following steps:

- Go to [mezo.org](https://mezo.org/) and click **Log in** to connect to your Mezo account.
- Connect an Ethereum wallet to Mezo Testnet. See the [Connect to Mezo Testnet](/docs/users/getting-started/connect/) guide for instructions.
- Get testnet BTC on Testnet. See the [Stack matsnet BTC](/docs/users/getting-started/mezo-matsnet-alpha-testnet/stack-matsnet-btc) guide to learn more.

## Borrow and mint

After you are logged into [mezo.org](https://mezo.org/) on an account with testnet BTC, you can borrow MUSD.

1. In your browser, open [mezo.org/feature/borrow](https://mezo.org/feature/borrow).

1. Click the **Let's Go** button to start the borrow process. 

1. Specify the amount of MUSD you want to borrow and the amount of BTC you want to use as collateral.

1. Check the summary details to confirm the information is as you expect.

1. Ensure that your browser wallet is actively set to Mezo Testnet.

1. When you are ready to proceed with the [Borrow and Mint](/docs/users/musd/mint-musd) process, click **Confirm**. Your browser wallet prompts you to confirm the transaction and pay the gas fees using BTC on Testnet.

After the process is complete, you can check the loan status on [mezo.org/feature/borrow](https://mezo.org/feature/borrow).

## Understand the borrowing terms

Mezo offers a fixed, low-interest rate for MUSD loans. Initial rates range from 1-5%. There is no forced repayment date on Mezo, so you can keep your position open as long as you want, provided your collateral remains sufficient.

While there’s no fixed repayment schedule, you still need to watch for liquidation risks if the value of your collateral (BTC) falls.

Interest accrues on the borrowed amount (the minted MUSD), so be mindful of how your debt grows over time. When you’re ready to close your position, you’ll need enough MUSD to cover your principal plus any accrued interest or fees.
