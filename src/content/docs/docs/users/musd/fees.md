The MUSD system fees are split between the MUSD treasury stability pool (which covers liquidations and bad debt) and veMEZO voters. The initial portion is 50/50, but this is subject to change based on the MUSD splitter.

## Interest Fees (1â€“5% APR)

Interest on MUSD loans is fixed for the life of the loan. When credit is increased, the new credit will be added at the current interest rate.

During Phase 1 of Mezo, interest fees fund the MUSD treasury stability pool, which covers liquidations and bad debt. Future allocation of fees can be decided by veMEZO stakers.

## Redemption Fees (0.5%)

This fee is paid when exchanging MUSD for the BTC collateral. When a user has an outstanding loan, the redemption fee is zero. Users who do not have an outstanding MUSD loan must pay the 0.5% redemption fee. 

During Phase 1 of Mezo, redemption fees fund the MUSD treasury stability pool, which covers liquidations and bad debt. Future allocation of fees can be decided by veMEZO stakers.

## Issuance fee (0.5%)

The issuance fee is paid when an MUSD loan is opened. The fee is 0.5% of borrowed MUSD (paid in MUSD). (a $10k MUSD loan would pay a $50 issuance fee in MUSD)

## Refinance fee (0.1%) 

The refinance fee is incurred when a MUSD loan holder extends their line of credit or reduces the amount of collateral backing their loan. Refinancing fees are paid in MUSD. 

## Gas Deposit ($200 flat fee)

A $200 deposit ensures liquidations are viable; it is returned when the loan is closed.

## Other Gas & Transaction Fees

Users interacting with the MUSD system will have to pay transaction fees for each transaction broadcasted to Mezo Network. This includes actions such as minting, redeeming, staking, and claiming. 

## MUSD Savings Rate

MUSD holders are able to stake their MUSD to receive the MUSD Savings Rate. This rate is paid in mats emissions. veBTC holders can vote on the gauge to adjust the incentives received by MUSD stakers and, in exchange, receive the interest and fees of the MUSD system.
