â€‹Mezo is a Bitcoin-centric platform designed to enhance Bitcoin's utility through seamless borrowing, spending, and earning. Bitcoin has changed how people think about money, control, security, and transparency. Bitcoin excels as a store of value, but it currently lacks the tools to make it easily usable in everyday financial activities. Mezo bridges this gap by creating a Bitcoin-native ecosystem that transforms BTC from a static asset into a dynamic financial tool.

Using tBTC's infrastructure as a secure and decentralized foundation, Mezo aims to offer a platform where people can use their Bitcoin in the following ways: 

- Mortgages funded by BTC collateral
- Everyday purchases made through Bitcoin-backed credit lines
- Grow wealth without ever selling

This is what it means to make Bitcoin supernormal. Mezo's goal is to embed Bitcoin so deeply within existing financial systems that using it feels as natural as swiping a debit card.

## Accessing Bitcoin Equity Without Selling

Bitcoin holders own one of the most sound assets ever created, but accessing its value requires selling it. Most existing solutions come with unpredictable costs, compromised sovereignty, and limited usability. Bitcoin loans typically have volatile rates between 8% and 20% APR, making long-term financial planning difficult. Additionally, many platforms force users onto non-Bitcoin chains or require giving up control to third parties.

Mezo solves these fundamental challenges by providing users with fixed-rate Bitcoin loans. All loans are issued and settled onchain, with 24/7 verifiable reserves. Mezo's borrow feature eliminates rate volatility while preserving users' complete sovereignty over their assets. 

By building a Bitcoin-native capital infrastructure with transparent pricing and no middlemen, Mezo enables users to access the value of their Bitcoin for real-world use cases without compromising on the security principles that make Bitcoin valuable.

Mezo's core features include MUSD; a stablecoin backed entirely by Bitcoin reserves. Mezo's environment offers secure core financial tools and permissionless innovation space to be built on top of MUSD to support a growing Bitcoin-based economy. Mezo is built on tBTC's infrastructure and emphasizes user ownership and trust minimization. The native incentive system, Tigris, rewards long-term participants in the ecosystem.
