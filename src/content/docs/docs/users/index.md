## Welcome to Mezo

The increasing adoption and value of Bitcoin have highlighted its limitations in transaction speed and scalability, necessitating the development of solutions that expand its capabilities while preserving its core principles. Mezo addresses this challenge by serving as Bitcoin's economic layer. As an economic layer, Mezo provides infrastructure and protocols for Bitcoin-based payments, investments, and self-banking. It enables Bitcoin-centric market structures and fosters innovation in Bitcoin-native financial products and services. Built on tBTC, Mezo offers a Bitcoin-first design emphasizing user ownership, reliable bridging, BTC-denominated gas fees, and a dual staking model. It provides the infrastructure to bridge Bitcoin with decentralized and traditional finance.

This framework transforms Bitcoin into a dynamic asset capable of generating yield and participating in diverse financial activities, thus aligning with the broader vision of BitcoinFi. BitcoinFi is the next evolution in the Bitcoin ecosystem, transforming it from a passive store of value into a dynamic, yield-generating asset. By integrating tBTC, Mezo, and Acre, BitcoinFi aims to create a thriving financial ecosystem where Bitcoin can be used productively across various applications.

Mezo is foundational to BitcoinFi, providing the necessary infrastructure and economic framework to seamlessly interact with tokenized Bitcoin assets within a bustling DeFi ecosystem. This integration enhances Bitcoin's utility and financial capabilities, bringing us closer to a future where Bitcoin serves as the cornerstone of a decentralized financial system and the preferred monetary asset of the world.
