title: Depositing Stablecoins
---

Depositing ERC-20s follows the same flow as wrapped BTC assets (tBTC and WBTC).

Once you go to the "Deposit from Ethereum" page, you can select the stable asset of your choice.

The same locking mechanisms apply: you receive multipliers on your daily mats based on the lock period.

Your Boost on BTC score is displayed in the top right banner and added to your daily BTC mats.
