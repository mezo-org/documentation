### Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoins and Other ERC-20s

**Assets:** crvUSD, thUSD, USDe, USDC, USDT, DAI, T

**Base Score:** 500 mats per 40k USD per day, and 40K T earns 15 mats per day.

**Lock-Up Multiplier:** The [same lock-up multipliers](mats-for-btc.md) apply for stable deposits

**BTC Bonus:** Daily mats from Bitcoin-backed stables are applied to boost your BTC mats. The boost can be up to 100% of your mats generated from BTC deposits.

_Currently, the BTC boost is only available for accounts that have deposited tBTC, WBTC, or another ERC-20 Bitcoin wrapper._

Your boost and cap can be from one stable deposit or a combination of multiple.&#x20;

### Example: crvUSD

Let's calculate Alice's daily mats from her stablecoin and BTC deposits. Assume Alice deposits 2 BTC and $20,000 crvUSD into Mezo.

#### Stablecoin Calculation

* Every 1,000 units of crvUSD earn 12.5 mats/day&#x20;
* crvUSD deposited: $20,000
* Daily mats from crvUSD: 20 x 12.5 x 16x multiplier = 4,000

#### BTC Calculation&#x20;

* Each BTC earns 1,000 mats/day&#x20;
* BTC deposited: 2 BTC
* Daily mats from BTC: 1,000 x 2 BTC x 16x multiplier = 32,000

#### Total Calculation&#x20;

* BTC-backed stable boosts daily BTC mats by up to 100% of BTC score.
* Alice will earn an additional 4,000 on her BTC mats, bringing her daily mats to 36,000.

**Final Daily Score: 32,000 from BTC + 4,000 from BTC boost + 4,000 from stables = 40,000 mats**
