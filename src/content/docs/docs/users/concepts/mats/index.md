## What are mats?

mats, or "magic satoshis," are Mezo's way of recognizing and rewarding participation through an engaging, community-driven point system. These points are designed purely for interaction within the Mezo ecosystem—**they hold no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for Mezo tokens or other currencies.**&#x20;

mats are collectible points that you can use to play games, tip fellow community members, participate in raffles, and more on the Mezo server.&#x20;

### **How Can You Obtain mats?**

You can earn mats through various activities in the Mezo community, including:

* **Weekly Events**: Attend [WateringHODL](https://discord.com/invite/mezo) events, where mats are tipped during community gatherings every Friday at 3 pm EST.

### **What Can You Do With mats?**
