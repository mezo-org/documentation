## Bitcoin

**Assets:** BTC, tBTC, WBTC, SolvBTC, SolvBTC.BBN, fBTC, swBTC, intBTC

**Base Score:** 1,000 mats per Bitcoin locked per day &#x20;

**Lock-Up Multiplier:** Longer lock-up periods give a mats multiplier

| Lock-up period (months) | Multiplier |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| 2                       | 3x         |
| 6                       | 10x        |
| 9                       | 16x        |

_Note: In the case of overlapping deposits, we apply the highest lock duration mats multiplier. This means if you extend your 2-month lock to instead be 6-months, you will get a 10x multiplier on your daily mats._
