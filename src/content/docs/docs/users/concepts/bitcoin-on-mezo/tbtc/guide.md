---

## Before you mint <a href="#before-you-start" id="before-you-start"></a>

Here are some things you will need before you start the minting process:

✅ Bitcoin (BTC)

✅ Ethereum (ETH) for Ethereum transaction gas costs

✅ Bitcoin compatible wallet&#x20;

✅ Ethereum compatible wallet

_**Note:** Depositing to mint tBTC can be done with any Bitcoin wallet address. Legacy, Native Segwit, Taproot, etc. are all valid._&#x20;

## Start minting tBTC <a href="#start-minting-tbtc" id="start-minting-tbtc"></a>

_Head to the tBTC dapp to begin minting:_ [_https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint_](https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint)

### Step 1: Generate a deposit address <a href="#step-1-generate-a-deposit-address" id="step-1-generate-a-deposit-address"></a>

Connect your preferred Ethereum wallet to the tBTC dapp by selecting **Connect Wallet**.

Enter a Bitcoin wallet address as the BTC Recovery Address. Click **Generate Deposit Address** to create your unique deposit address.

**IMPORTANT:**  Native Segwit (addresses that start with "bc1q") is the ONLY accepted address type for refunds. Refunds occur if something goes wrong during the mint and BTC must be refunded to your wallet. XVerse wallet addresses are _not_ supported for tBTC returns.

Make sure to download the JSON file by clicking **Download**. The JSON file contains a wallet public key, a refund public key, and a refund lock time. You need to keep this JSON file until you receive your tBTC tokens.

Sign the transaction in your Ethereum wallet.&#x20;

### Step 4: tBTC Minting <a href="#step-4-tbtc-minting" id="step-4-tbtc-minting"></a>

Your mint is now in progress! **You don't need to remain in the dapp to wait for your tBTC tokens to mint**.&#x20;

You can see the status of your mint in the dapp and on [tBTCscan](https://tbtcscan.com/). The first stage requires 1 confirmation on the Bitcoin Network before advancing to the next step.
