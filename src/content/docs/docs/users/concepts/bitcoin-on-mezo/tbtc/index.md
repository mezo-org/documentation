### Summary

tBTC is a trust-minimized BTC bridge, built by [Thesis](https://thesis.co/) and powered by the [Threshold Network](https://threshold.network/), that has been live since April 27th, 2020.&#x20;

With tBTC:

* Your BTC is not custodied by a few companies but a decentralized network.&#x20;
* Anyone can mint or redeem tBTC: it's completely permissionless.&#x20;
* The entire bridging process can be observed in real-time to see the flow of funds (at [tbtcscan](https://www.tbtcscan.com))

Today, tBTC is **the only long-term scalable and decentralized bitcoin bridge**, which is why Mezo uses tBTC as its foundation.&#x20;
