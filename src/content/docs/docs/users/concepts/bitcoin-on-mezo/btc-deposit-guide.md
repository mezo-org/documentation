title: BTC Deposit Guide

We support **all Bitcoin address types** except for Taproot from UniSat, OKX, and Xverse wallets. Users with BTC on a Ledger device can use Xverse to access Mezo.&#x20;

We will soon add support for MagicEden and expand Ledger support.

#### **Bitcoin Wallets:** <a href="#bitcoin-wallets" id="bitcoin-wallets"></a>

You can log in with UniSat, OKX, and Xverse and use the following addresses:

| Name           | Script Type | Address Prefix |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Legacy         | P2PKH       | 1              |
| Native SegWit  | P2WPKH      | bc1q           |
| Nested SegWit  | P2SH-P2WPKH | 3              |

### Depositing BTC

The various lock options give a mats boost ranging from 3x to 16x. Your daily HODL score calculation is based on various lock times and deposit sizes.

Click "Continue" to deposit from your Unisat or OKX wallet.&#x20;

Or toggle the "Send from another wallet."&#x20;

This supports deposits from any Bitcoin address type **except for Taproot,** meaning you can deposit directly from your favorite exchange, hardware wallet, or another source.

If you choose to deposit from another address, you will be directed to the following screen, where you can scan the QR or copy the address.&#x20;

Send the BTC to the listed address and wait for your deposit to process.
