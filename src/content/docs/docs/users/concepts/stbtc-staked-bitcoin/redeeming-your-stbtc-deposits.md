For those who participated in this journey by minting stBTC and depositing crv-stBTC into the Portal, this is a guide to unlocking your assets.

_Note:_ _Redeeming your stBTC will not change the underlying deposits. Your WBTC or tBTC used to mint stBTC will continue to earn daily mats._

Returning stBTC is free. If you deposited crv-stBTC, you'll have to wait for the lock period to expire before returning your assets. This adjustment aligns with supporting a secure and adaptive ecosystem ready to meet new demands and minimize risks as we prepare for testnet.

## Steps to Conclude Your stBTC Cycle&#x20;

1.  **Unlock crv-stBTC Deposits**: crv-stBTC deposits in the Portal will become accessible once the unlock period is complete. Users can view balances and initiate withdrawals as they become available.

**Important Notes**

The annual minting fee will not be raised at this time, though they may be adjusted to zero or modified as necessary ahead of the chain launch.

This transition supports the continued growth and stability of the Mezo ecosystem
