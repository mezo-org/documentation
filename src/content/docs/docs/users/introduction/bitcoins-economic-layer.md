title: What is BitcoinFi?
---

BitcoinFi (short for Bitcoin Finance) refers to the broader vision of Bitcoin as a full-fledged financial ecosystem rather than just a static asset or digital gold. The vision of “doing everything on Bitcoin”, from saving and earning to borrowing and paying, is at the heart of BitcoinFi. This concept involves integrating Bitcoin into all aspects of finance, making BTC a seamless part of everyday economic activities. 

A BitcoinFi ecosystem is achieved by combining Bitcoin's reliability and security with the kind of financial applications and yield opportunities that exist on networks like Ethereum and other DeFi platforms, then extending that into regular, real-world finance.

Key aspects of BitcoinFi include:

- Expanding Bitcoin’s Utility: BitcoinFi turns Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a dynamic financial asset. With BitcoinFi, you can use BTC to earn interest, fund loans, power decentralized apps, and access cost-effective financial services, all natively tied to Bitcoin​. This greatly expands what Bitcoin can do beyond hodling. Your BTC can be collateral for loans, liquidity for exchanges, or staking.
- Fueling Adoption: By broadening Bitcoin’s capabilities, BitcoinFi creates a powerful feedback loop to drive adoption​. This new utility makes Bitcoin useful to a wider audience (not just long-term investors), which attracts more users to try it for everyday needs. As more people use Bitcoin in new ways, it entices more developers to build additional Bitcoin-centric applications, further enriching the ecosystem.

Mezo’s role in BitcoinFi is critical to turning this vision into reality. Mezo is the BitcoinFi playground where Bitcoin dApps live. This means Mezo will become the primary platform hosting the new generation of Bitcoin-based applications – from lending protocols and stablecoin issuers to decentralized exchanges and beyond. By being an EVM-compatible chain anchored to Bitcoin, Mezo provides the infrastructure for developers to build Bitcoin-native dApps and for users to access them with their BTC.
