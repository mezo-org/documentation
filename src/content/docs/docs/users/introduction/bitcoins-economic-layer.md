BitcoinFi (short for Bitcoin Finance) refers to the broader vision of Bitcoin as a full-fledged financial ecosystem rather than just a static asset or digital gold. The vision of “doing everything on Bitcoin”, from saving and earning to borrowing and paying, is at the heart of BitcoinFi. This concept involves integrating Bitcoin into all aspects of finance, making BTC a seamless part of everyday economic activities. 

A BitcoinFi ecosystem is achieved by combining Bitcoin's reliability and security with the kind of financial applications and yield opportunities that exist on networks like Ethereum and other DeFi platforms, then extending that into regular, real-world finance.

Key aspects of BitcoinFi include:

- Expanding Bitcoin’s Utility: BitcoinFi turns Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a dynamic financial asset. With BitcoinFi, you can use BTC to earn interest, fund loans, power decentralized apps, and access cost-effective financial services, all natively tied to Bitcoin​. This greatly expands what Bitcoin can do beyond hodling. Your BTC can be collateral for loans, liquidity for exchanges, or staking.
- A Circular Bitcoin Economy is the Outcome: A local or global network where salaries, retail sales, taxes, and supplier payments are all settled on or backed by BTC without round‑tripping through fiat.

 A circular Bitcoin economy turns BTC into a salary, a shopping cart, and a tax remittance tool. Mezo’s role in BitcoinFi is critical to turning this vision into reality with yield, borrowing, native DEX, and everyday marketplace. When these layers interlock, Bitcoin can serve as both day‑to‑day money and the base asset for sophisticated financial services, closing every gap that once pushed users back to fiat.
