title: Mezo - A Self-Service, Free-Banking Economy for Bitcoiners
description: Learn about how Mezo offers a self-service Bitcoin banking service where you can borrow against BTC collateral.
---

Mezo is the onchain Bitcoin banking platform owned by its users. Users can access self-service Bitcoin finance without interacting with loan officers, undergoing credit checks, or observing operational hours. It’s just you, your Bitcoin, and permissionless access to financial services 24/7.

Traditional banks profit from your deposits while charging you for access to your own money. Two-sided lending markets trap you with 8-9% variable rates that can spike unpredictably, especially in decentralized financial systems. Both systems put middlemen between you and your wealth.

Mezo eliminates them all, giving you the power to manage your finances intelligently on your own terms.

# Flagship Feature: Fixed Rate Bitcoin Loans
## MUSD: Bitcoin-Backed Money with Complete Autonomy
Deposit Bitcoin as collateral, mint MUSD (a dollar-pegged stablecoin), and use it however you need. Your Bitcoin stays yours while MUSD provides you with instant liquidity. Fixed rates start as low as 1% and stay fixed for the entire life of the loan. 

This is self-service banking with complete autonomy. Unlike any traditional banking experience, there are no minimum payments, set repayment schedules, or penalties for early repayment. Close your position tomorrow or keep it open for years. 

It's your Bitcoin and your decision on what to do with it.

## Core Features
### Bitcoin Loans (MUSD)
Self-service loans at fixed 1% rates. Borrow MUSD against your Bitcoin and manage everything yourself. With Mezo’s 110% minimum collateralization ratio, you can access up to 90% of your Bitcoin's value.

### Bitcoin Savings Accounts (Yield Vaults)
Deposit BTC or MUSD into automated vaults that generate yield through lending, liquidity provision, and DeFi strategies. Like a high-yield savings account, but transparent, onchain. No minimum balance, withdraw anytime.

### Native Swaps
Trade directly on Mezo without leaving the platform. Swap between BTC, MUSD, and other assets with deep liquidity and competitive rates.

### Mezo Market
Spend your MUSD on real goods and services. Buy gift cards, pay for subscriptions, and access everyday purchases, all without selling your Bitcoin. Coming soon: direct offramps to your bank account and seamless fiat bridges.

### BTC as Gas
Every transaction on Mezo is paid in Bitcoin. This keeps the experience pure Bitcoin while creating a revenue stream that flows back to participants in the Mezo ecosystem.

### Community Governance (veBTC)
Lock BTC to become a co-owner of the infrastructure. veBTC holders vote on protocol parameters, receive fee distributions, and shape the future of the platform. This isn't token governance—it's Bitcoin holders owning their bank.

### Built on tBTC
The most battle-tested decentralized Bitcoin bridge with 24k+ BTC bridged since 2020. Reserves are verifiable 24/7, so you don’t need to rely on trusted third parties.

### Permissionless Building
Full EVM compatibility means developers can build without permission. Create new financial products, integrate existing protocols, or invent entirely new use cases. The same ethos as Bitcoin: open, permissionless, unstoppable.

### Build on Mezo
Mezo is a permissionless and EVM-compatible blockchain. Developers can build whatever they want to enrich the global Bitcoin economy.

# For Developers:

# Away From the System
Bitcoin was the people's response to 2008, an escape hatch from boom-bust cycles that grow more violent with each round of money printing. But Bitcoin alone isn't enough. We need infrastructure to use it productively without compromise.

Mezo creates a parallel financial system where you never have to sell your Bitcoin, never have to ask permission, and never have to trust anyone but yourself. Not reforming the old system, but replacing it. Not asking for permission, but building permissionlessly. Not trusting institutions, but verifying code.

This is self-service banking for the Bitcoin era.
