[The Mezo Portal](https://mezo.org/hodl) is open today for various Bitcoin and Bitcoin-backed stablecoin deposits.

Mezo is Bitcoinâ€™s economic layer, which allows Bitcoin holders to cultivate their Bitcoin. It bridges Bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi), traditional finance, and real-world applications.

### Key objectives and benefits:

* Enable Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi activities without losing exposure to BTC
* Provide a platform for Bitcoin-denominated financial services and applications

* Offer seamless user experiences for both end-users and developers

### Mezo Design Architecture:

2. **Bitcoin-First Design:** Mezo is specifically designed for Bitcoin holders, emphasizing user ownership and alignment with Bitcoin's core principles.
   * BTC for Gas: This unique feature allows users to pay transaction fees in BTC, maintaining a pure Bitcoin experience and advancing Bitcoin as a cultural payment currency.
3. **Dual Staking Model:** Combines rewards and validation to incentivize network participation and security.
4. **BitcoinFi Ecosystem:** A suite of Bitcoin-native financial applications, including lending, borrowing, and yield generation.
5. **Real-World Applications:** Tools and protocols to bridge BitcoinFi with traditional finance and business operations.
6. **Developer-Friendly Environment:** Supports Ethereum and Cosmos developers.
