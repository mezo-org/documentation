# What is Mezo?

asdfasdfs



Mezo is a Bitcoin-centric platform purpose-built to make Bitcoin productive in day-to-day finance. It is EVM-compatible, which means it can host decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts in a system that developers and users already understand.

Using tBTC's infrastructure as a secure and decentralized foundation, Mezo aims to offer a platform where people can use their Bitcoin in the following ways:

* Mortgages funded by BTC collateral
* Everyday purchases made through Bitcoin-backed credit lines
* Grow wealth without ever selling

This is what it means to make Bitcoin supernormal. Mezo's goal is to embed Bitcoin so deeply within existing financial systems that using it feels as natural as swiping a debit card.

### Mezo design features

* **MUSD and Borrow:** Tap into your Bitcoin equity at competitive, fixed rates. Borrowers create MUSD by opening a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP), posting BTC as collateral to mint MUSD, a dollar-pegged stablecoin usable for spending, trading, lending, and borrowing.
* **BTC for Gas:** Mezo Network uses BTC as its native gas token. This maintains a pure Bitcoin experience and advances Bitcoin as a cultural payment currency while providing a stream of fee revenue paid in BTC.
* **tBTC Integration & Multi-Chain Support:** Mezo is built on tBTC, the largest decentralized Bitcoin bridge in production. By robustly tokenizing Bitcoin, holders can utilize their Bitcoin across EVM chains in a secure and reliable manner. Reserves are verifiable 24/7 at [tbtc.scan](http://tbtc.scan).
* **Dual Staking Model:** Combines rewards and validation to incentivize network participation and security.
* **BitcoinFi Ecosystem:** A suite of Bitcoin-native financial applications, including lending, borrowing, and yield generation.
* **Developer-Friendly Environment:** Supports Ethereum and Cosmos developers.

### What does it mean to be Supernormal?

Supernormal is boring in a good way.

It's when something is so easy to use and familiar that it becomes naturally integrated into life. Users don't even really think about it anymore. It just makes life better.

Despite being around for over a decade, Bitcoin is still viewed as new and shiny, a little scary, hard to use, and weird for most people. Bitcoin must become supernormal. Its usage should be as natural and easy to use as a coffee maker, favorite pair of shoes, or water bottle.

Users shouldn't need a degree in finance or be millionaires to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for everybody and for doing everyday things. For Bitcoin to be impactful, it has to evolve from being weird to a few to being "normal" to many. For crypto native users, being "normal" is the last thing wanted. That's why Bitcoin needs to be supernormal.

Mezo makes Bitcoin supernormal by enabling easy access to Bitcoin's value without selling it, fixed-rate loans for predictable financial planning, transparent on-chain operations, and familiar financial tools rebuilt on Bitcoin infrastructure. Soon, everyone will be able to use Mezo to do supernormal stuff with Bitcoin, like buy things on a credit card, send money immediately, save for college, apply for a loan, and more.

### Access Bitcoin Equity Without Selling

Bitcoin holders own one of the most sound assets ever created, but accessing its value requires selling it. Most existing solutions come with unpredictable costs, compromised sovereignty, and limited usability. Bitcoin loans typically have volatile rates between 8% and 20% APR, making long-term financial planning difficult. Additionally, many platforms force users onto non-Bitcoin chains or require giving up control to third parties.

Mezo solves these fundamental challenges by providing users with fixed-rate Bitcoin loans. All loans are issued and settled onchain, with 24/7 verifiable reserves. Mezo's borrow feature eliminates rate volatility while preserving users' complete sovereignty over their assets.

By building a Bitcoin-native capital infrastructure with transparent pricing and no middlemen, Mezo enables users to access the value of their Bitcoin for real-world use cases without compromising on the security principles that make Bitcoin valuable.

Mezo's core features include MUSD; a stablecoin backed entirely by Bitcoin reserves. Mezo's environment offers secure core financial tools and permissionless innovation space to be built on top of MUSD to support a growing Bitcoin-based economy. Mezo is built on tBTC's infrastructure and emphasizes user ownership and trust minimization. The native incentive system, Tigris, rewards long-term participants in the ecosystem.
