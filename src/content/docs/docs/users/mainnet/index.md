title: Mainnet Launch
---

The Mezo Mainnet launch is scheduled for May. Existing depositors must be aware of the following items:

- Default Behavior: All deposits will be automatically bridged to Mezo mainnet unless you opt out. This means on Day 1, your assets will be “unlocked” and usable for anything on Mezo—including minting MUSD, earning through Mezo apps, and more. You won’t need to wait for your original unlock period to end.
- Opting Out: You can opt out of bridging and receive your assets on their original chain (Bitcoin or Ethereum) by going to the “Deposit” tab and selecting the “Off” switch on any eligible deposit. If you opt out, your assets will be unlocked on Ethereum at mainnet launch. The deposit contract on Ethereum will no longer function post-launch.
- WBTC: WBTC deposits will be bridged to Mezo as tBTC, with standard network and processing fees applied. WBTC will not be eligible to be bridged to Mezo via the native bridge. 

As an example, a tBTC deposit unlocking on August 31 will be auto-bridged to Mezo in May, at mainnet launch. If the user decides to opt out, they will receive their deposit in their EVM wallet on the date of Mezo mainnet launch.

For additional details about the Mainnet launch, see the [Mezo Mainnet Announcement](https://blog.mezo.org/mezo-mainnet-is-coming/) blog post.

## Opting out of auto-bridging

Users with existing deposits can disable auto-bridging for individual assets in the Mezo portal. By default, all eligible assets are enabled for auto-bridge to Mezo mainnet. You must disable specific assets before Mezo Mainnet launch if you want them unlocked on Ethereum rather than bridged automatically.

To opt-out of an asset, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your [Mezo Portal](https://mezo.org) account.

1. Go to the [Mezo Portal Deposit Tab](https://mezo.org/deposit).

1. For each asset you want to opt-out, click the **On** button to toggle it to **Off**.

Assets set to **Off** will not be auto-bridged to Mezo Mainnet on launch day.
