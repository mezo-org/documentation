mats, or "magic satoshis," are Mezo's way of recognizing and rewarding participation through an engaging, community-driven point system. These points are designed purely for interaction within the Mezo ecosystem. **They hold no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for tokens or other currencies.**

mats are collectible points that you can use to play games, tip fellow community members, participate in raffles, and more on the Mezo server.

You can continue to earn mats on Mezo Mainnet. Deposits continue to earn mats only if the assets are bridged to Mezo Mainnet. The details for how mats were bridged to Mainnet is described on the [Mezo Blog](https://mezo.org/blog/final-steps-before-mainnet-activating-your-mats-rewards/).
