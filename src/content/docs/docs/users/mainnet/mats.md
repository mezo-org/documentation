mats, or "magic satoshis," are Mezo's way of recognizing and rewarding participation through an engaging, community-driven point system.

You can continue to earn mats on Mezo Mainnet. If you opted out of auto-bridging your assets to Mezo Mainnet and your lock period extends past the Mezo Mainnet launch date + 30 days, those assets continue to be locked during that period and continue earning mats at your lock setting rate. If your lock period extends the Mezo Mainnet launch date for less than 30 days, your lock expires and you stop earning mats on your scheduled unlock date.

The details for how mats were bridged to Mainnet are described in the [Mezo Blog](https://mezo.org/blog/final-steps-before-mainnet-activating-your-mats-rewards/).

## Earning and using mats

You can earn mats through various activities in the Mezo community, including:

* **Bridging assets to Mezo Mainnet**: Until June 30th, 2025, you are eligible for a one-time bridge bonus. The mats rewards will be calculated and delivered after that date.
* [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/mezo) **Community Events**: Join raffles, receive tips, complete quests, and participate in games and bounties.
* **Weekly Events**: Attend [WateringHODL](https://discord.com/invite/mezo) events, where mats are tipped during community gatherings.
