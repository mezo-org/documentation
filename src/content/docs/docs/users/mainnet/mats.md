mats, or "magic satoshis," are Mezo's way of recognizing and rewarding participation through an engaging, community-driven point system. These points are used in the Mezo app specifically on the [Mezo Market](https://mezo.org/market).

mats are collectible points that you can use to play games, tip fellow community members, participate in raffles, and more on the Mezo server.

You can continue to earn mats on Mezo Mainnet. If you opted out of auto-bridging your assets to Mezo Mainnet and your lock period extends past the Mezo Mainnet launch date + 30 days, those assets continue to be locked during that period and continue earning mats at your lock setting rate. If your lock period extends the Mezo Mainnet launch date for less than 30 days, your lock expires and you stop earning mats on your scheduled unlock date.

The details for how mats were bridged to Mainnet are described in the [Mezo Blog](https://mezo.org/blog/final-steps-before-mainnet-activating-your-mats-rewards/).
