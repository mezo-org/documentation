## Developer Onboarding

To bring your dApp to Mezo, you can follow one of two paths: the permissionless deployment path, which is open to all, or [apply for our high-support Alpha Builder Program.](https://2d0lnha7ee6.typeform.com/to/B9jzgjb6?ref=mezo.org&typeform-source=mezo.org)

### Choose Your Onboarding Path

* **Alpha Builder Program:** If you’re looking for dedicated onboarding and co-marketing support from the Mezo team, [apply for the Alpha Builder Program.](https://2d0lnha7ee6.typeform.com/to/B9jzgjb6?ref=mezo.org&typeform-source=mezo.org)&#x20;
* **Permissionless Deployment:** You can deploy permissionlessly at any time. For community DevRel support during deployment, join the [Mezo Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mezo). Ask your question in the general channel, and you’ll be directed to the developers' channel, where you can access weekly DevRel office hours.

### Development and Deployment Steps

* Read the [dApp Requirements](https://mezo.org/docs/developers/getting-started/dapp-requirements) to be eligible for featuring in the [Mezo Market](https://mezo.org/market) and other promotional support.
* [Configure your development environment](https://mezo.org/docs/developers/getting-started/configure-environment) for Mezo.
* Complete the Deploy your dApp to Mezo tutorial to learn the full dApp development and Passport integration process on Mezo.
* Deploy your dApp to the Mezo testnet. Use the [Mezo Testnet network details](#mezo-testnet).
* Stress test the dApp to make sure it functions as expected. The Mezo testnet is the best place to find issues early before deploying to Mezo Mainnet.
* Deploy your dApp to Mainnet. Use the [Mezo Mainnet network details](#mezo-mainnet).
* Monitor your dApp. Set up monitoring and alerts to track the health of your dApp and alert you to any issues. See the Monitoring guide for details.
