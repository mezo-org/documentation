Several organizations are partnering with Mezo to bring their dApps and services to the network.

## Goldsky

Goldsky is an indexer for web3 builders that offers subgraph hosting and realtime data replication pipelines. Goldsky [is available on Mezo Testnet](https://docs.goldsky.com/chains/supported-networks) using the slug `mezo-testnet`.

## Stork

Stork is an oracle protocol that enables ultra low latency connections between data providers and both on and off-chain applications. The most common use-case for Stork is pulling and consuming market data in the form of real time price feeds for DeFi. Stork [is available on Mezo Testnet](https://docs.stork.network/resources/contract-addresses/evm#mezo).

## Supra 

Supra is a cross-chain oracle network designed to power dApps across blockchain ecosystems with fast, secure, decentralized, and scalable data solutions. Supra's [Distributed Oracle Agreement (DORA)](https://docs.supra.com/oracles/data-feeds#distributed-oracle-agreement-dora) is available on Mezo Testnet. See the Supra's [Available Networks](https://docs.supra.com/oracles/data-feeds/pull-oracle/networks) page to find the correct pull contract and storage contract addresses.

## Pyth

The [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/) is one of the largest first-party Oracle networks and delivers real-time data across several chains including Mezo. Pyth introduces an innovative low-latency [pull oracle design](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/on-demand) where users can pull price updates onchain when needed. This enables everyone in the onchain environment to access data points efficiently. The Pyth network updates the prices every 400ms to make Pyth one of the fastest onchain oracles.

Pyth contracts:
- Mezo Mainnet: [0x2880aB155794e7179c9eE2e38200202908C17B43](https://explorer.mezo.org/address/0x2880aB155794e7179c9eE2e38200202908C17B43)
- Mezo Testnet: [0xA2aa501b19aff244D90cc15a4Cf739D2725B5729](https://explorer.test.mezo.org/address/0xA2aa501b19aff244D90cc15a4Cf739D2725B5729)

See the [Pyth Documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/home) to learn how to use Pyth in your dApp.

## Onchain Den

Den provides a self-custodial multi-signature wallet for onchain organizations, and is available on Mezo. Onchain Den also worked with Mezo to provide SAFE infrstructure at [safe.mezo.org](http://safe.mezo.org/).
