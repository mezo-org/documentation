# dApp Requirements

Although the network is permissionless and anybody can deploy to Mezo Mainnet, dApps on Mezo must meet the following requirements to be featured in the [Mezo Market](https://mezo.org/market) and receive promotional support:

* **Mezo Passport**: Developers must use [Mezo Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mezo-org/passport) in their dApps to provide additional wallet connection options specifically tailored for Bitcoin wallets and Mezo Mainnet. Passport does not require a specific development environment and is a React library that works with [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com/).
* [**Audit Report:**](https://rainbowkit.com/) The dApp must have completed a third-party security audit. The report must be submitted to the Mezo team via the intake form.
* **Mainnet Functionality:** The dApp must be fully deployed and functional on Mezo Mainnet.
* **MUSD Integration**
